  <h1>Athina on iExec - Project Status</h1>
  <p></p>
  <h2> Milestone one: a simple chatbot</h2>
  <p><b>Description:</b> Build a basic NLP agent running on iExec computational resources.</p>
  <p><b>Status:</b> Completed [2018-03-09 Fri]</p>
  <p><b>Summary:</b> A basic neural dialogue agent, employing a sequence to sequence model, has been trained, added to docker image javiermares/tiny-chat, and deployed to the iExec network.</p>
  <p>As the first component of milestone two, a second agent has also been deployed: a character level model which improvises prose in the style of Cervantes. This is the first model fine-tuned for this task, to the knowledge of the author.
  <p>We want to show the unique capabilities of iExec and blockchain, like fine grained collaboration between dapps. As a first step in that direction, one illustrative idea could be to use the improvised prose from the Cervantes app as an input to a neural calligraphy generator, so it looks like a handwritten note from Cervantes. Other similar ideas are being worked on.</p>

  <p><b>Dapps</b><p>
  <p>Improvising Cervantes v0.04 - iexec submit 'python3 /examples/nlp/dime_algo.py' --dapp 0x25412143e4c5392dea108c2834008985507410f2</p>
  <p>Tiny Chat v0.03 - iexec submit 'python /iexec/oneturn.py how are you' --dapp 0x2e785496d4f66BF1e2dDFba1a7755eb2EbF75d2C</p>
  
  <p><b>Comments:</b><p>
  <p>UPDATE [2018-04-11 Wed]: Francois mentioned that iExec has a bug whereby it won't find scripts located in the Docker image's root directory (eg. iexec submit 'python oneturn.py' --dapp would be incapable of finding oneturn.py. As a temporary measure, the script is now at /iexec/oneturn.py instead.</p>
  <p>Now iExec can find the script, but the script itself is unable to find filenames. This is an iExec bug, as this doesn't happen when running the command in Docker (eg.  docker run javiermares/tiny-chat python /iexec/oneturn.py hey dude). <a href="https://iexec-team.slack.com/archives/C3Y0MJN8Y/p1523411097000034">The slack discussion can be found here.</a></p>

  <p>"Bridge Failed" iExec bug [2018-03-09 Fri]. There seems to be an issue on iExec with the cmdline variable. It works fine for a command like 'python3 /examples/nlp/dime_algo.py', but the longer command associated with the Tiny Chat dapp produced a "Bridge Failed" error. The command is 'iexec submit 'python oneturn.py hello' --dapp 0x2e785496d4f66BF1e2dDFba1a7755eb2EbF75d2C' where 'hello' represents the user input string. It works on the associated docker image, javiermares/tiny-chat. This error has been raised in the beta-testers slack channel and Francois mentioned it will be looked at on Monday.</p>

<p></p>
<h2>Milestone two: an ensemble of dapp agents</h2>
  <p><b>Description:</b> Build at least one more agent which would work with the first one in an ensemble fashion.</p>
  <p><b>Status:</b> Completed.</p>
  <p><b>Summary:</b> A second dapp agent, Improvising Cervantes, has been completed and improved. An expert manager has been implemented on Python to triage user queries between the two agents.</p>
  <p><b>Dapps, scripts:</b><p>
  <p>Improvising Cervantes v0.04 - iexec submit 'python3 /examples/nlp/dime_algo.py' --dapp 0x25412143e4c5392dea108c2834008985507410f2</p>
  <p>Expert manager v0.02 - Usage: python3 expertmanager 'your input here'
    (A normal query will get a response from the Tiny Chat dapp. The query "En que piensa Cervantes?" will return a bit of prose in the style of Cervantes. <a href="https://github.com/lev-kusanagi/iexec-dapp-samples/tree/expertmanager">Source code.</a>)</p>
